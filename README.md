## Systematic Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Task Reception & Analysis
- **Task-Master-AI Integration**: Automatic task retrieval and progress tracking
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Research specialist conducts architecture assessment, dependency audit, and security analysis
- **Documentation Review**: PRD, architecture specs, and tech stack analysis

### Phase 2: Systematic Planning
- **Task Prioritization**: Break down complex tasks with dependency analysis
- **Resource Allocation**: Plan agent deployment sequence and coordination points
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify failure points and define contingency strategies
- **Quality Gate Definition**: Set mandatory checkpoints and success criteria

### Phase 3: Implementation Pipeline
- **Coordinated Development**: Backend and frontend engineers work with architectural guidance
- **Validation Pipeline**: Continuous validation and integration testing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Progress tracking and proactive conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Quality Gate Enforcement
Sequential quality gates that must pass:
1. **Implementation Verification**: Feature completeness and pattern compliance
2. **Testing Pipeline**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, performance benchmarks
3. **Security & Debugging**: Security scans, debugging verification, error handling
4. **Documentation & Standards**: Complete documentation, code review, architecture compliance

### Phase 5: Deployment Coordination
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated workflows and issue lifecycle management
- **Version Control**: Structured commits with conventional messages
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated quality checks and deployment pipelines
